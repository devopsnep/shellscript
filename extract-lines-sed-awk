awk '/Recipients by message count/{p=1}!$0{p=0}p' input_file
       OR
sed -n '/Recipients by message count/,/^\s*$/ p' files.txt  | sed -n '1!{2!{$!p}}'

    # Use awk with a flag to trigger the print when necessary:

$ awk '/abc/{flag=1;next}/mno/{flag=0}flag' file
def1
ghi1
jkl1
def2
ghi2
jkl2
How does this work?

/abc/ matches lines having this text, as well as /mno/ does.
/abc/{flag=1;next} sets the flag when the text abc is found. Then, it skips the line.
/mno/{flag=0} unsets the flag when the text mno is found.
The final flag is a pattern with the default action, which is to print $0: if flag is equal 1 the line is printed.




	
If you want to print everything between and including the pattern then you can use awk '/abc/{a=1}/mno/{print;a=0}a' file
 
 		
Yes, @scai ! or even awk '/abc/{a=1} a; /mno/{a=0}' file - with this, putting a condition before the /mno/ we make it evaluate the line as true (and print it) before setting a=0. This way we can avoid writing print.
 		
@scai @fedorqui For including pattern output, you can do awk '/abc/,/mno/' file  
  	
 		
@scai,@fedorqui : In the above how can we include abc and exclude mno. â€“ hkasera Dec 10 '14 at 18:04

@hkasera awk '/abc/{flag=1}/mno/{flag=0}flag' file should make.
